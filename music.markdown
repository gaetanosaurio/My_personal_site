**Macrophylla** 


I'm the guitarist, the singer and the songwriter of the project called [**Macrophylla**](https://www.youtube.com/@macrophylla/){:target="_blank"}. 

It's a music project inspired by nature, the sea, my garden and any positive vibration from the great mother.

Feel free to reach me also at my Instagram profile [**here**](https://www.instagram.com/_macrophylla_){:target="_blank"}.

**Jazz Manouche** 

I love the music of the master masters Django Reinhardt and sometimes try to play his incredible classic music like Minor Swing, Les Yeux Noir, Nuages, and many other extraordinary songs.
