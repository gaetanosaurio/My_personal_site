**Poommarobot**\
I developed and implemented a new platform for a remote-controlled social robot called [**Poommarobot**](http://www.poommarobot.com/){:target="_blank"}, with autonomous behaviors, based on Android smartphones.

Received awards for best innovation, and participated in innovation conferences as a panelist or keynote speaker:

- III, IV e V editions of [*The European Edition of Maker Faire*](https://makerfairerome.eu/it/){:target="_blank"} awarded with 2 *Maker of Merit* (2016, 2017).
- *"Excellence of the Campania Region"* award, 2017 edition.
- Mention in various journalistic articles ([*Il Mattino*](https://www.ilmattino.it/caserta/pommarobot_il_genio_casertano_a_bruxelles-1753830.html){:target="_blank"}, [*Corriere della Sera*](https://napoli.corriere.it/notizie/cultura-e-tempo-libero/16_maggio_30/atterra-bruxelles-poommarobot-mondragone-f86ed366-266e-11e6-b1b0-4b98745ed321.shtml){:target="_blank"}, [*Repubblica*](https://www.repubblica.it/tecnologia/2017/12/02/news/maker_faire_dall_orto_2_0_alla_pentola_robot_la_top_five_da_non_perdere-182803932/){:target="_blank"}, *Panorama*, *Wired*, [*Le Scienze*](http://oldani-lescienze.blogautore.espresso.repubblica.it/2016/06/07/robot-con-la-pummarola-in-coppa/){:target="_blank"}, [*Apogeo online*](https://www.apogeonline.com/articoli/robot-in-tutte-le-salse-paolo-capobussi/){:target="_blank"}, etc.), television and web interviews ([*Tom's Hardware*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22tW0sN1RSM){:target="_blank"}, *RaiNews24*, [*I fatti vostri*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcIFUoErJXs){:target="_blank"}, [*L'aria che tira*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nScTjIOHSgY&t=42s){:target="_blank"}, [*Il Messaggero*](https://www.ilmessaggero.it/video/tech/maker_faire_2015_poommarobot_il_robot_pentola-175083.html){:target="_blank"}, etc.).

**Big Data advanced analytics applications**\
I developed and implemented new Advanced Analytics software solutions for a big IT company dedicated to processing data produced by industrial machinery through distributed architectures based on microservices, IoT, and Big Data technologies.
In a team of two, we built an entire pipeline on time, allowing value from data, time saved, and increased sales for the customer.


**Cyber Garden** \
I plan to build a system to understand and take care of ornamental and food plants. There are many challenges besides species recognition: helping with the harvest, optimization of weeding spraying, monitoring of disease/pests, vegetables and fruit picking, etc. The idea is to build very cheap robots (smartphone-based) capable of learning from the observation of the gardener/farmer. In the poorest areas of the world, everyone has a smartphone.
