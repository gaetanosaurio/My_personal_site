## Welcome!
I'm Gaetano Saurio, computer scientist, [**robot maker**](http://www.poommarobot.com/){:target="_blank"}, musician, singer, songwriter, and gardener of a 1000 squared meters sub-tropical forest.

## A brief bio
As of January 2023, I've just started my [**PhD**](https://phd.uniroma1.it/web/GAETANO-SAURIO_nP2078553_IT.aspx){:target="_blank"} in Data Science at the Sapienza University of Rome. 

I love to explore and deepen how to leverage data to help humans in everyday life. 

My research interests are Geometric Deep Learning, Graph Neural Networks, Computer Vision, Precision Agriculture, etc. 

I often imagine how to use AI to reduce our impact on this planet.  

I do everything possible every day to improve my technical skills without putting aside creativity, openness and humanity.
