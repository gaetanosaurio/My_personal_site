I started my [**PhD in Data Science**](https://phd.uniroma1.it/web/GAETANO-SAURIO_nP2078553_IT.aspx){:target="_blank"} at the Sapienza University of Rome on November 2022. 

I'm interested in Graph Neural Networks, Computer Vision, advanced CNNs, Geometric Deep Learning, Precision Agriculture, Generative AI, etc.

I love to explore and deepen how to leverage data to help humans and reduce our impact on this planet. 

I'm also a Computer Science teacher, corporate trainer, robot maker, musician, gardener and coastal dune enthusiast.
